description: Generate a pull-quote / insight card — TWO pixel-exact HTML canvases in one file: 1080×1080 (square, default) AND 1080×1920 (story variant). Text-dominant, Fraunces-led, no chrome. The quote IS the artifact. Reads ./design/<brand-slug>/DESIGN.md, tokens.css, and components.html. Triggers include "quote card for X", "pull quote", "insight card", "/quote-card".

# Skill: quote-card

Produces a single self-contained HTML file containing TWO pixel-exact canvases:

1. **Square** (1080×1080) — Instagram feed / LinkedIn / generic social
2. **Story** (1080×1920) — Instagram Story / Reel cover / vertical share

Both render the same quote at proportional scale for their format. Screenshot each separately for the appropriate platform.

This is the artifact format most prone to AI-default tells: large opening quotation mark glyph (❝), centered alignment as default, color-gradient backgrounds behind text. **All three are explicitly banned in this skill.** The quote IS the artifact — typography carries everything.

## When to use

- User wants to share a single insight, claim, or pull-quote as a standalone card
- A `DESIGN.md` exists for the brand

## Inputs

- **Required:** brand slug, the quote text (1 sentence, sentence-case ending in period per brand voice; max ~25 words)
- **Optional:** attribution (e.g. "Shane Logsdon, 2026" — usually omitted if the brand IS the speaker)
- **Optional:** source — link to the longer piece the quote is from
- **Optional:** type-accent — one word in the quote to set in `--color-accent`

## Output

`./design/<brand-slug>/artifacts/quote-card-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`

## Steps

### 1. Verify brand exists

```bash
test -f ./design/<brand-slug>/tokens.css
```

### 2. Gather the brief

Ask in one message:

```
1. Quote text — 1 sentence, sentence-case ending in period (max ~25 words; push back if longer)
2. Optional attribution — name + date, OR omit if the brand IS the speaker
3. Optional source — URL to the longer piece this quote is from
4. Optional type-accent word — one word from the quote to set in the brand's accent color (used as a SUBJECT marker, not generic emphasis)
```

If the user provides 26+ words, push back: "Quote cards work at 25 words or fewer. Cut the support — keep the claim. What's the line that lands?" Don't proceed until they agree.

### 3. Pick variation — ARCHITECTURE FIRST

Pick ONE archetype — quote cards reward severe restraint:

- `type-only` — the quote at MAX scale, asymmetric anchor (top-left or bottom-right), no chrome. Strongest for short claims.
- `inverse-text` — full canvas dark inversion (canonical v2 feature treatment). The quote in cream on ink. Reads with conviction.
- `pattern-led` — repeating text fragments as background; the quote breaks through as the punctum. Risky — only use if the quote concept invites the device.
- `inverted-text` — quote carved out of a body-text wall (the body is the negative, quote is the positive). Editorial-architectural.

Then pick:
- **Layout**: `top-anchored | bottom-anchored | off-grid | center-anchored` (center-anchored only if the quote is a single short line — center as default is the AI tell to avoid)
- **Color usage**: `monochrome | single-accent | inverted` (inversion often strongest for quotes)

**Cross-artifact rule:** if a recent quote card for this brand used the same archetype, vary it. Two quote cards in a row with the same treatment dilutes both.

### 4. Generate the HTML

Template:

### 5. Verify

- [ ] Both canvases at exact dimensions (1080×1080 + 1080×1920)
- [ ] Quote is at most 25 words; ends in period per brand voice
- [ ] **No quotation mark glyphs around the quote** (❝ ❞ " " — banned as decorative)
- [ ] Layout is NOT center-anchored (unless the quote is a single short line and center is genuinely the right anchor)
- [ ] Architecture archetype documented AND differs from the most recent quote card for this brand
- [ ] **Read `../design-anti-patterns.md` and verify the artifact violates none of its rules.** Pay special attention to sections 1 (no gradients behind text — text on solid surface only), 2 (no italics-emphasis OR single-word color emphasis as decoration), 4 (architecture must reach inner blocks), and 5 (no editorial-cosplay markers)
- [ ] Type-accent (if used) is on the SUBJECT word of the quote, not a generic adjective
- [ ] No attribution if the brand IS the speaker (avoid the "— Shane Logsdon" cliché on Shane's own quotes)
- [ ] Story canvas respects IG chrome (top 270px / bottom 240px reserved padding for app UI)

## Rules

- **No quotation mark glyphs.** The decorative ❝/❞ around a pull quote is the format's most-overused tell. Typography carries the weight; the glyphs add nothing.
- **No gradient backgrounds.** Quote on a solid surface — cream OR inverted ink. No purple-to-cyan, no anything-to-anything.
- **Centered layout requires justification.** Default to top-anchored, bottom-anchored, or off-grid. Centered is fine for one-line quotes where it's the right answer — never as a default reach.
- **Word count: 25 max.** Push back on the user if longer. Quote cards land at the speed of a single read.
- **Pixel exactness on both canvases.**
- **Token-pure.** Every visual value via `var(--*)` from tokens.css.
- **Anti-pattern compliance.** This skill defers to `../design-anti-patterns.md` as the canonical anti-tell list.
